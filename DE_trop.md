# Sex specific

## Male specfic (Y)

- `Xetrov90003943m` , Chr.01

## Female biased

- `LOC100497740`, Chr.07: mlc2 (`AC160829.3`) = myosin light chain 2

### Looking into scaffolds:
- `a2ml1`: scaffolds in *X. tropicalis* and *X. laevis*) --- very small exons
- `LOC100145515`: Predicted E3 ubiquitin ligase (after blasting against mRNA database on xenbase) - See [Ehrlund et al. 2009] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2663311/) and from [Uniprot page of fem-1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P17221):

*Sex-determining protein; essential for the adoption of the male sexual fate in all tissues. Substrate recognition subunit of the cullin-RING-based CBC(fem-1) (Cul2-ElonginB-ElonginC) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates in association with cofactors fem-2 and fem-3 the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of tra-1.*

- `ambp`: Chr.08L in *X.laevis*

## Male biased

- `gene369` = ph1 (`XR_001923395.1`) = polyhomeotic-like protein 1, scaffold 130.

[Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q64028):
```
Tissue specificity:
Highly expressed in testis with lower levels in most other tissues. Expressed in embryonic stem cells

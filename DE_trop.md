- `Xetrov90003943m` , Chr.01

## Female biased

- `LOC100497740`, Chr.07: mlc2 (`AC160829.3`) = myosin light chain 2

### Looking into scaffolds:
- `a2ml1`: scaffolds in *X. tropicalis* and *X. laevis*) --- very small exons
- `LOC100145515`: Predicted E3 ubiquitin ligase (after blasting against mRNA database on xenbase) - See [Ehrlund et al. 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2663311/) and from [Uniprot page of fem-1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P17221):

*Sex-determining protein; essential for the adoption of the male sexual fate in all tissues. Substrate recognition subunit of the cullin-RING-based CBC(fem-1) (Cul2-ElonginB-ElonginC) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates in association with cofactors fem-2 and fem-3 the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of tra-1.*

Blasted (blastx) exon of 489bp (`scaffold_281 scaffold_281:98337..98825`) on NCBI to identify potential domain:
```
RING-HC_TRIM47_C-IV 	cd16604 	
RING finger, HC subclass, found in tripartite motif-containing protein 47 (TRIM47)
	2-49 	3.86e-0
  
RING finger, HC subclass, found in tripartite motif-containing protein 47 (TRIM47) and similar proteins
TRIM47, also known as gene overexpressed in astrocytoma protein (GOA) or RING finger protein 100 (RNF100), belongs a subclass of TRIM (tripartite motif) family of proteins that are defined by their N-terminal RBCC (RING, Bbox, and coiled coil) domains, including three consecutive zinc-binding domains, a C3HC4-type RING-HC finger, a B-box, and two coiled coil domains, as well as a B30.2/SPRY (SplA and ryanodine receptor) domain positioned C-terminal to the RBCC domain. It plays an important role in the process of dedifferentiation that is associated with astrocytoma tumorigenesis.

For protein see genbank `AAI61185.1`. 

It seems to be a specific copy of *X. tropicalis*. A copy of the gene is on chromosome 8 in *X. tropicalis* and 8L/S in *X.laevis*.

Designed primers using the ref. `XM_018090095.1` and specificity to *X.tropicalis*. Designed primers for 2 big exons: exons 4 and 6.

- `ambp`: Chr.08L in *X.laevis*

## Male biased

- `gene369` = ph1 (`XR_001923395.1`) = polyhomeotic-like protein 1, scaffold 130.

[Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q64028):

Tissue specificity:
Highly expressed in testis with lower levels in most other tissues. Expressed in embryonic stem cells

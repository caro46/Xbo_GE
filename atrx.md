# Why is it a good target ?

- Location
- involve in sex determination / sex reversal in other species --- need to put references here

# Region

Atrx.L is a big gene with a lot of small exons and big introns. 1 exon is big a contain the ADDz_ATRX. Since it is still at the "beginning" of the protein it seems to be a good targetted region.
But the region is small and crisprscan only found 2 overlapping guides, not great. Other domains can be interesting:

## Sex biased?

Using transcriptomic data --- no (except misc_RNA in adult testis). ---> need to find a better candidate.
